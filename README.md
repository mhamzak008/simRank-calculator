# simRank-calculator
Multi-core implementation of an application which finds scientific articles with most similar citations. The application uses the simRank algorithm, proposed by Jeh and Widom: http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/508/1/2001-41.pdf

Our code is in the directory, sim-rank/src/

The rest of the directories are all SNAP: http://snap.stanford.edu/snap/index.html
